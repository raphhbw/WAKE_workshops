This repository contains material which will be used during the WAKE workshops. This is a stable version that ideally will only change incrementally.
Use this branch to avoid having to rebuild the container after minor changes!

The most efficient way to use the juputer workbooks is to clone this repository and run jupyter notebooks locally.

If you are not able to install anything on your computers due to restrictions, then you can also use the services of mybinder.org
