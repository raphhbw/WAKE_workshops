Glossary
===
This top-level file is a place to collect definitions for some of the machine learning jargon used throughout this course.
Although definitions will be introduced at the relevant times in the workshops, this can be used as a quick-reference guide.

Model: mathematical function that generates our prediction (NN)

Loss Function/ Cost function: How well we're learning the dataset based on outputs ()

Optimiser: Changes model parameters to minimise the loss function (Gradient based optimisation - default in ML)

Activation function: Rectifies the outputs (Sigmoid: probability, ReLU: non-negative, more complex)
